_**Current Status**_

As of **Friday, Oct 30, 2020**, the Autopilot initial model schema is being created based on the [situational design document](./situational-design.md). In addition, the voice user interface (VUI) is being created. By Friday, Nov 6, 2020 the goal is to have an early `alpha` version available for testing the VUI. This initial version will not be connected to live APIs and will used mock APIs so we can focus on refining the the VUI without any backend concerns.
